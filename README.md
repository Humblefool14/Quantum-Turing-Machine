Summer Madness

This is meant as a project based on Quantum Computing. For the next three months i want to work extensively work in this field. Read through the lecture notes, solve the assignments, write my thoughts about the difficulties as well things which are quite interesting.

Write some code for few operations and algorithms by the end of this project.

I am reading the books/lecture notes in this order.

I want to use the forest from Rigetti Computing for the simulations. And use IBM-Q for the simulation of gates and circuits. I loved the interface, though.

By the end of the project, I hope to simulate atleast one paper in the Quantum computing area
